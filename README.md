# keras-tuner
script to tune hyperparameter in neural network with kerastuner

I recently came across the Keras Tuner package, which appears to serve the same goal than GridSearchCV/RandoGridSearchCV and so but for Neural Network.

To get keras-tuner, you just need to do pip install keras-tuner.

For this tutorial, I am using keras-tuner version 1.0.0

If you want this specific version use :

pip install keras-tuner==1.0.0
